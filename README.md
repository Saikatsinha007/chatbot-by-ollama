## Overview

This project features a state-of-the-art medical chatbot that leverages AI and semantic search technologies to provide real-time medical consultations. Built with Hugging Face’s T5 model fine-tuned on medical data and integrated with the Ollama model, the chatbot can process up to 5 queries per minute with high accuracy and contextual relevance.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Chatbot**: Utilizes Hugging Face’s T5 model, fine-tuned for medical applications to ensure precise and context-aware responses.
- **Semantic Search**: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) provides fast and efficient retrieval, with response times consistently under 300 ms.
- **Real-Time Query Handling**: Processes up to 5 queries per minute with minimal latency.
- **Streamlit Deployment**: Deployed with Streamlit for an intuitive user experience and real-time interaction.

## Performance Metrics

The chatbot’s effectiveness has been validated through comprehensive performance evaluations:

| Metric         | Score |
| -------------- | ----- |
| **Accuracy**   | 0.85  |
| **Precision**  | 0.87  |
| **Recall**     | 0.83  |
| **F1-Score**   | 0.85  |
| **BLEU Score** | 0.82  |

These metrics highlight the model’s ability to generate contextually relevant and accurate medical responses.
